In Python 3, classes extend object implicitly, whether you say so yourself or not.

In Python 2, there's old-style and new-style classes.
To signal a class is new-style, you have to inherit explicitly from object.
 If not, the old-style implementation is used.

You generally want a new-style class.
 Inherit from object explicitly.
 Note that this also applies to Python 3 code that aims to be compatible with Python 2.
